# 📘 UNISZA Confession Bot Documentation (v1.1)

## 1. Overview
The **UNISZA Confession Bot** (@autosent_robot) is an automated utility for managing the UniJa Confession Telegram ecosystem. It schedules religious reminders, maintenance stickers, and specialized commercial advertisement posts that link directly to comment threads.

## 2. Core Features
*   **Dynamic Scheduled Broadcasts:** Automated delivery of Al-Mulk, Selawat, and Midnight Stickers.
*   **Dual-Platform Posting:** Syncs messages between the main Channel and the Discussion Group.
*   **Smart Ad Threading:** Posts ads into a specific group thread and generates a "Jump Link" button on the channel post for easy navigation.
*   **Auto-Cleanup (Maintenance):** Automatically deletes the previous day's advertisement/reminders to keep the channel feed clean.
*   **HTML Parsing:** Uses HTML mode for channel posts to ensure compatibility with Telegram handles containing underscores (e.g., `@iklansewa_unisza`).

## 3. Configuration System (`CONFIG`)

### Message Schema Extensions
| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `caption` | Now supports HTML tags (e.g., `<b>`, `<i>`, `<a>`). |
| `extraButtonText` | The label for the second interactive button. |
| `extraButtonUrl` | The destination link for the second button. |
| `deletePrevious` | Boolean; if true, the bot wipes the last message of this category before posting. |

## 4. Technical Workflow

### The Broadcast Logic (`executeBroadcast`)
1.  **Old Message Deletion:** Checks `PropertiesService` for `LAST_ID_` and attempts to delete the previous iteration of the message.
2.  **Group Sync:** 
    *   Sends a Markdown-formatted instruction to the discussion group.
    *   Targets the specific "Iklan Niaga" thread using `parentMessageId`.
3.  **Link Generation:** Captures the Group Message ID to create a deep link (e.g., `https://t.me/unijaconfession/123?comment=456`).
4.  **Channel Delivery (HTML Mode):** 
    *   Sends the photo and caption to the channel.
    *   **Parsing Mode:** Switched to **HTML** to prevent errors when Telegram handles or text contain special characters like underscores (`_`).
    *   **Buttons:** Attaches an inline keyboard with two buttons (Thread Link and External Link).

## 5. Security & Error Handling
*   **Exception Muting:** The script uses `muteHttpExceptions: true` to prevent the Daily Reset trigger from failing if a message was already manually deleted.
*   **State Persistence:** Message IDs are stored in `PropertiesService` to maintain "memory" across script executions.

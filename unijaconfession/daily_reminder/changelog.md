# 📜 Changelog

### [v1.1] - 2024-05-22
**Added**
- **Multi-Button Support:** Implemented an `extraButton` system within the `iklanNiaga` category.
- **Emoji Branding:** Added icons (`📝`, `🏘️`) to inline buttons to improve UI/UX.
- **HTML Parsing Integration:** Changed `parse_mode` from `Markdown` to `HTML` for channel broadcasts to fix a bug where underscores in usernames (e.g., `@iklansewa_unisza`) caused the bot to fail.

**Fixed**
- **Underscore Crash:** Resolved an issue where the bot failed to post to the channel if the caption contained an unclosed markdown symbol.
- **Caption Formatting:** Updated `iklanNiaga` caption with improved spacing and bold HTML tags.

**Changed**
- **Button Layout:** Updated the inline keyboard to display two buttons side-by-side for the "Iklan Niaga" post.
- **Logic Refinement:** Optimized the `executeBroadcast` function to handle both Sticker objects and Message objects more cleanly.
